    <p>
    Light is the essence of photography. SpriteBrush transforms your smartphone or tablet into an enchanted light painting brush.
    </p>

    <p>
    Light painting is the art of illustration with long-exposure photography and a handheld light source. The marvelous colors, patterns, and effects in SpriteBrush add fun and creativity to your light painting photos. 
    </p>


    <h1>What You'll Need</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>A camera with long-exposure capabilities. A digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera set to "bulb" is ideal.</li>
    <li>A tripod or steady brace for your camera</li>
    <li>A dim or dark room, or suitably dark outdoor space</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Your First Light Painting</h1>

    <p>
    Choose a SpriteBrush brush style, open the camera shutter, paint your image, then close the camera's shutter. Your camera's shutter may be open from a just few seconds to several minutes, depending on your composition.
    </p>

    <p>
     Never shoot in a space with obstacles, drops, or tripping hazards. Practice your technique in a well-lit space before shooting.
    </p>

    <h1>Tips</h1>

    <ul>
    <li>Set your smartphone or tablet's brightness setting to manual. Adjust the brightness for optimal illumination if necessary.</li>
    <li>Disable your smartphone or tablet's sleep feature.</li>
    <li>Have an assistant operate the camera's shutter, or use a remote shutter release trigger.</li>
    <li>Tweak your camera's ISO and aperture if your first attempts are over- or underexposed.</li>
    </ul>

             Animated brushes cycle through a loop or randomly change. Use trial &amp; error to match the speed of your lightbrush stroke with the speed of the animation. Too fast a stroke with too slow an animation won't show much change; a slow stroke with a fast animation might blur.

    <h2>Stencils</h2>

    <p>

            Speed
            </td>
            <td class="value">
            Stencils flash onscreen for a brief burst, like a camera shutter. Your selection from the speed palette screen sets the time between flashes. Choose a fast speed to increase the number of stencil images that appear in a stroke, or a slow speed to capture fewer stencils.
