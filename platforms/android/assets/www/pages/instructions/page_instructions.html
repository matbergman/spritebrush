    <p>
    Light is the essence of photography. SpriteBrush transforms your smartphone or tablet into an enchanted light painting brush.
    </p>

    <p>
    Light painting is the art of illustration with long-exposure photography and a handheld light source. The marvelous colors, patterns, and effects in SpriteBrush add fun and creativity to your light painting photos. 
    </p>


    <h1>What You'll Need</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>A camera with long-exposure capabilities. A digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera set to "bulb" is ideal.</li>
    <li>A tripod or steady brace for your camera</li>
    <li>A dim or dark room, or suitably dark outdoor space</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Produce a Light Painting</h1>

    <p>
    Choose a SpriteBrush brush style, get in position, open the camera's shutter, paint your image, then close the camera's shutter. Depending on your composition, your camera's shutter may be open from a just few seconds to several minutes. 
    </p>

             Animated brushes cycle through a loop or randomly change. For best results, match the speed of your lightbrush stroke with the speed of the animation. Too fast a stroke with too slow an animation won't show much change; a slow stroke with a fast animation will blur.

    <h2>Stencils</h2>

    <p>
    Decorate your light painting with ornamental illustrations. Stencils are high contrast line drawings that blink on your SpriteBrush screen and appear as recognizable images in your long exposure light painting photo.

            </td>
            <td class="value">
            Stencils flash onscreen for a brief burst, like a camera shutter. Your selection from the speed palette screen sets the time between flashes. Choose a fast speed to increase the number of stencil images that appear in a stroke, or a slow speed to capture fewer stencils.

    <h2>Flashlight</h2>

    <p>
    Sometimes a bright white LED is just what your composition needs. This button appears if your device has a built-in assistive light.    
    </p>

    <h1>Tips</h1>

    <ul>
    <li>Ask a friend to operate the camera's shutter, or use a wireless remote</li>
    <li>Adjust your camera's ISO depending on the ambient illumination</li>
    <li>Crank up your smartphone or tablet's brightness to its maximum value</li>
    <li>Disable your smartphone or tablet's sleep feature </li>
    <li>Practice your technique in a well-lit space. Don't shoot in a space with obstacles or tripping hazards</li>
    </ul>
